<p>The Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) became law after receiving the President’s assent on 
Thursday, following a bruising debate in Parliament. Assam has been in the throes of violence since Wednesday,
 when Rajya Sabha took up the Bill after it was passed in Lok Sabha, with its capital under indefinite curfew, 
 and Army and paramilitary columns rolling across multiple towns.
At least three Opposition ruled states — Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal —have said they will not implement the
 new citizenship law, and legal challenges have been made in the Supreme Court.
